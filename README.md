### Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R Data and Examples

Data retrieved from the authors' website: https://highstat.com/index.php/mixed-effects-models-and-extensions-in-ecology-with-r


#### R2 of mixed effects models

Calculating goodness of fit and performance of mixed effects models are not easy, according to statistical literature.

I direct it to Dr. Jaeger's dissertation work:An R2 statistic for fixed effects in the generalized linear mixed model.

And his package 'R2glmm: computes R squared for mixed (multilevel) models'

I will try to integrate analyses with R2glmm pacakge.
